/**
 * <b>MyFarm</b> is a farming simulation game, where the player acts as the sole farmer (and manager) of their own farm.
 * The gameplay typically involves the following tasks:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Buying seeds,
 * <li>Preparing land,
 * <li>Planting seeds,
 * <li>Advancing days (err… watching crops grow), and
 * <li>Harvesting crops
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There’s obviously a lot more to the game, but that’s the general idea. There’s also no real end goal to this
 * game – as in many simulation games. However, to make things clear, the game can theoretically go on forever and the
 * player can continue to play for as long as they want except in the case when they (1) don’t have any active/growing
 * crops and (2) don’t have enough money to buy new seeds. The player also cannot continue if all the tiles in their
 * farm lot contain withered crops (i.e. crops that died due to lack of care). When either situation happens, the game
 * ends and the player is asked if they’d want to start a new game or simply exit the program.
